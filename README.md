# Fun with Interaces, episode 3: Testing

This repository is a collection of demos for the "Fun with Interfaces, episode 3: Testing" live blog on http://vjeko.live/

This is what each branch is (or does):
* `demo-01`: Shows a typical approach to testing, and explains their problems
* `demo-02`: More functionality results in more tightly-bound tests - and this time it's even worse!
* `demo-04`: Introduces the concept of test doubles
* `demo-08`: Puts three kinds of test doubles to use in testability: stubs, mocks, fakes
