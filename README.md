# Fun with Interaces, episode 3: Testing

This repository is a collection of demos for the "Fun with Interfaces, episode 3: Testing" live blog on http://vjeko.live/

This is what each branch is (or does):
* `demo-01`: Shows a typical approach to testing, and explains their problems
* `demo-02`: Explains a concept of test doubles (mocks, fakes, and stubs)
* `demo-03`: Puts test doubles to use in testability
